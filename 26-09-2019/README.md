### Problem of the Day:
Find the starting and ending position of a given target value in array of integers nums sorted in ascending order.

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n)

### Example:
```javascript
  Input: nums = [3,4,7,7,9,9,9,10], target = 9
  Output: [4, 6]
  Input: nums = [3,4,7,7,9,9,9,10], target = 8
  Output: [-1, -1]
```
