### Problem of the Day:
Given a M x N grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

### Example:
```shell script
  Input:
  [
    [1,3,1],
    [1,5,1],
    [4,2,1]
  ]

  Output: 7
  Why?: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
