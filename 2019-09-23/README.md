### Problem of the Day:
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example:
```text
  Input: (6 -> 5 -> 4) + (8 -> 7 -> 3)
  Output: 4 -> 3 -> 8
  Explanation: 456 + 378 = 834.
```
