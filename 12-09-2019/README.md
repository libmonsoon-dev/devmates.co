### Problem of the Day:
Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.
### Example:

```text
  Input: [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
  Output: [1, 3, 4]

  Why?
     1            <---
   /   \
  2     3         <---
   \     \
    5     4       <---
```
