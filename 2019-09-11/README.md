### Problem of the Day:
In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the i-th barcode is barcodes[i].

Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. You may return any answer, and it is guaranteed an answer exists.
### Example:

```text
  Input: [1,1,1,2,2,2]
  Output: [2,1,2,1,2,1]

  Input: [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
  Output: [1,3,1,3,2,1,2,1]
```
